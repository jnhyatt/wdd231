        <article>
            <h3>What is everyone putting in space?</h3>
            <p>Hundreds of rockets fly to orbit every year, but why? Do we really have that much stuff to send up?
                Thousands of <a href="#" data-modal="definition-satellite">satellites</a> support everything from GPS
                and internet access to climate research, disaster response, and military surveillance. Space is also
                home to telescopes, science experiments, and even art. Some missions are commercial, some are
                governmental, and some are academic â€” but all of them rely on space as a unique platform where gravity
                and atmosphere donâ€™t get in the way.</p>

            <h3>What happens after launch?</h3>
            <p>Does launching satellites leave space junk in orbit forever? When a satellite reaches the end of
                its life, its orbit is slowed until it falls back to earth, safely burning up in the atmosphere.
                Satellites in higher orbits are placed in <a href="#" data-modal="definition-graveyard-orbit">graveyard
                    orbits</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>How do rockets work?</h3>
            <p>Newton's third law says that for something to move forward, it has to push something else backward. In
                the vacuum of space, there's no ground or air to push against, so rockets have to carry their own
                reaction mass. Carrying an entire rocket to orbit would require a massive amount of fuel, so rockets are
                designed with multiple <a href="#" data-modal="definition-stage">stages</a>, which can be jettisoned
                when they are out of fuel to reduce weight.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>The people of spaceflight</h3>
            <p>Every launch depends on thousands of people â€” from design engineers and technicians to safety officers
                and mission planners. There are specialists who work on countdown procedures, propellant loading,
                weather monitoring, and flight software. Once the rocket lifts off, tracking teams take over to monitor
                the mission from ground stations around the world. No one works alone, and every person plays a part in
                getting the payload safely to orbit.</p>

        <h2>Satellite</h2>
        <p>An object in orbit around a planet or other celestial body. Artificial satellites are used for various
            purposes, including communication, weather monitoring, and scientific research.</p>

        <h2>Graveyard Orbit</h2>
        <p>A high, stable orbit used to safely store retired satellites, keeping them out of busy operational zones like
            geostationary orbit.</p>

    <dialog id="definition-stage">
        <button class="close">âœ–</button>
        <h2>Stage</h2>
        <p>A section of a rocket with its own engines and fuel. Most rockets use multiple stages, discarding each one
            when it runs out of fuel to reduce weight.</p>
